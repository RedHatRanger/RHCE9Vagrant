```
============================================================
In the Exam we will have 6 Vms.
1-  One is controller node
2-  Five Vms will be used as Managed nodes.
============================================================
Finally we need 6 Virtual Machines for the practice.
Let Say,

3-  2 GB Ram is for Each VM   ( 12 GB)
4-  single core CPU with Each VM ( 6 Cores)
5-  Some of Memory/CPU will be taken by Vmware Workstation 
6-  Rest will be taken by Base os that can your Windows 11.
7-  you might live some live applications like zoom/team/meet, whatsapp, Google Drive, One Drive ( CPU and RAM)
=============================================================
What you need at least if you are using laptop with intel CPU.
8-  at least 16 GB ram in laptop
9-  At least corei7, 8th gen (4 Core and 8 MB cache)
10- Storage you must at least SSD or Recommendation is to 300 GB free space on nvme drive)
=============================================================
```


* Once all the nodes are up and the control node is up, ON THE CONTROL NODE:
```
[ansible@control ~]$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
[ansible@control ~]$ for i in {1..5}; do ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ansible@172.28.128.10${i}; done
```

* Here you will enter the passowrd "student" for each of the nodes 1-5

* Next, you will setup the repositories (if you are using Red Hat instead of Rocky Linux):
```
[ansible@control ~]$ sudo su
```
```
[ansible@control ~]# vim /etc/yum.repos.d/myrepo.repo

[BaseOS]
name=BaseOS
baseurl=file:///run/media/ansible/RHEL-9-4-BaseOS-x86_64/BaseOS
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

[AppStream]
name=BaseOS
baseurl=file:///run/media/ansible/RHEL-9-4-BaseOS-x86_64/AppStream
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

:wq
```

* First, install ANSIBLE-CORE, PYTHON3-PIP, and CONTAINER-TOOLS:
```
[ansible@control ~]# yum clean all
[ansible@control ~]# yum install -y ansible-core python3-pip container-tools
```

* Next, install and run ANSIBLE-NAVIGATOR (ONLY INSTALL ON CONTROL NODE):
```
[ansible@control ~]# pip install ansible-navigator
[ansible@control ~]# ansible-navigator
```

* It will begin pulling down the container execution environment and it will execute the process.
